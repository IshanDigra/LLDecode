# LLD (Low-Level Design) Compilation

A comprehensive collection of Low-Level Design problems, design patterns, and SOLID principles organized for systematic learning and practice.

## 🎯 Learning Path

This repository is structured to guide you through a progressive learning journey:

1. **SOLID Principles** → Foundation of good design
2. **Templates** → Standardized structure for new problems
3. **LLD Fundamentals** → Essential knowledge and best practices
4. **Design Patterns** → Proven solutions to common problems  
5. **LLD Problems** → Practice with real-world scenarios
6. **Concurrency Problems** → Advanced multi-threading challenges

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Beginners
1. Start with `01-SOLID-Principles/` to understand design fundamentals
2. Use `02-Templates/` to understand problem structure
3. Study `03-LLD-Fundamentals/` for essential knowledge and best practices
4. Explore `04-Design-Patterns/` to learn common solutions
5. Begin with `05-LLD-Problems/01-Beginner/` problems

### For Experienced Developers
- Jump to specific difficulty levels in `05-LLD-Problems/`
- Use templates in `02-Templates/` for consistent problem structure
- Study `03-LLD-Fundamentals/` for advanced best practices
- Practice concurrency problems in `06-Concurrency-Problems/`
