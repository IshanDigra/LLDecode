#Requirement
The logging framework should support different log levels, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL.
It should allow logging messages with a timestamp, log level, and message content.
The framework should support multiple output destinations, such as console, file, and database.
It should provide a configuration mechanism to set the log level and output destination.
The logging framework should be thread-safe to handle concurrent logging from multiple threads.
It should be extensible to accommodate new log levels and output destinations in the future.


Entities:
1) LogMessage: timestamp, content, log level
2) Configuration: handler, OutputDestination
3) OutputDestination: console, DB, File
5) handler(DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL) : logLevel, nexHandler, processLog

Enums:
1) logLevel


=> try to implement this using the chain of responsibility design pattern.

Core Functionalities: setting the configuration, various log modes.
Critical Section:


=> Happy flow ; User creates an instance of main handler. which is the entry point. when process log is called.
we check if the current level loglvl with respect to the cofiguration. else we process request.
