Approach would be to first list down entities, core functionalities under services, constants, exceptions.
Once you are done with this then we can define the variables and methods for models and services.
Start with just one service managing everything and then eventually we can break that down into smaller services.
based on the constrains and everything else.



=> Model: Customer, Restaurant, MenuItem, Order, DeliveryAgent, Payment

- Customer
V: id, name, email, contact brownie: orderHistory
M: placeOrder, brownie: viewOrderHistory

- Restaurant
V: id, name, address, menuItem, RestaurantAvailability
M: addMenuItem, removeMenuItem

- MenuItem
V: id, description, name, price, ItemAvailability
M:

- Order
V: id, orderItems, orderStatus, deliveryAgent, customer, Restaurant
M: addItem, removeItem, updateStatus, assignAgent

- DeliveryAgent
V: id, name, status, contact,
M:

=> Constant: ItemAvailability, RestaurantAvailability, AgentStatus, OrderStatus, PaymentStatus
=> Service: RestaurantService, OrderManagement, DeliveryManagement, PaymentProcessing, NotificationProcessing

- FoodDeliverySystem
V: Customers, Restaurants, DeliveryAgents, Orders, Instance,
M: addCustomer, addRestaurant, addAgent, viewMenu, placeOrder, updateOrderStatus, assignDeliveryAgent, Notification to customer, restaurant, deliveryagent
=> Exception:



* points to note:

1) whenever you are defining model items variable just try and look for real life based examples. for order we require status,
items, restaurant, deliveryAgent etc etc.
