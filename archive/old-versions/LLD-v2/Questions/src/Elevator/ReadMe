Entities: Building, Floors, Lifts, Display,InnerButtons, ExternalButton
Enums: direction, state
Core Functionalities: liftController, RequestDispatcher: Singleton



=> Display : floor, direction

=> Lift: id, direction, currentFloor, Display, InnerButtons, state,
    showDisplay(), pressButton(), Move(dir, destFloor)


=> InnerButton: LiftController
Inner button will take care of dispatching with in lift request to the lift controller;
What all scenarios can we come acrocss.
- lift moving up
if(requested floor < current floor) add to maxPriority queue
else add to minPriorityQueue
- lift moving down
if(requested floor > current floor) add to minPriority queue
else add to maxPriorityQueue

- lift idle
if(requested floor < current floor) add to maxPriority queue
else add to minPriorityQueue


=> ExternalButton will have instance of requestDispatcher the dispatcher will direct coming from floors to lift
based on certain strategy.

=> Floor : id, floorNumber, externalButtons
=> Building : list<Floors> can create a singleton design pattern for this.
add floor and stuff;

Note:
1) request Dispatcher could have various strategies to select a lift for this particular request.
2) Like wise multiple request could come to a particular lift controller. how we manage to deal with those is crucial.
