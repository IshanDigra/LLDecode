Lets say we have a class Car which has a drive strategy = simple. Now we make numerous child classes from the parent class.
Now comes a set of child classes that need sports Drive strategy likewise comes a set of child classes that requires sedan drive strategy.
Now In this case we have hit a roadblock. each child class would have to build their own drive strategy that would lead to code
duplication. Another example would be that you are making an app like google maps that tells the best route now you could take walking route
by road route, water route or some other route. this is a strategy to choose from. hence we use strategy design patterns for this.

Solution: Like the name suggests strategy pattern is Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
The strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from client to client.
