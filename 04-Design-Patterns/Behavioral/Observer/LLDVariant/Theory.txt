Observer pattern is basically subscribe-subscriber desgin pattern. In this we have observable interface and observer interface.
Observable interface has : add(), remove(), setData(), NotifyAll()
observer has update() whose input type is observable object. This is done to prevenet constructor injection of
observable in the oberver and insimple terms sharing the updated state of observable to the observer.

when the state of observable changes it notifies all its subscribers.
