# Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They provide reusable templates for solving recurring design challenges and help create more maintainable, flexible, and robust code.

## 📚 Categories

### 🏗️ Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexible ways to create objects without exposing creation logic.

**Patterns:**
- **Singleton** - Ensure only one instance exists
- **Factory Method** - Create objects without specifying exact classes
- **Abstract Factory** - Create families of related objects
- **Builder** - Construct complex objects step by step
- **Prototype** - Create objects by cloning existing instances

### 🏛️ Structural Patterns
Deal with object composition and relationships, helping you build flexible and efficient object structures.

**Patterns:**
- **Adapter** - Make incompatible interfaces work together
- **Decorator** - Add new functionality to objects dynamically
- **Facade** - Provide a simplified interface to complex subsystems
- **Composite** - Treat individual and composite objects uniformly
- **Proxy** - Provide a placeholder for another object
- **Bridge** - Separate abstraction from implementation

### 🎭 Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects, providing effective ways for objects to interact.

**Patterns:**
- **Observer** - Define one-to-many dependency between objects
- **Strategy** - Encapsulate algorithms and make them interchangeable
- **State** - Allow objects to alter behavior when internal state changes
- **Chain of Responsibility** - Pass requests along a chain of handlers
- **Mediator** - Define how objects interact with each other
- **Command** - Encapsulate requests as objects
- **Template Method** - Define algorithm skeleton with customizable steps
- **Iterator** - Provide sequential access to elements
- **Visitor** - Separate algorithms from object structure
- **Memento** - Capture and restore object state

## 🎯 Learning Path

1. **Start with Creational** - Understand object creation
2. **Move to Structural** - Learn object composition
3. **Finish with Behavioral** - Master object interaction

## 💡 When to Use Patterns

- **Don't over-engineer** - Use patterns when they solve real problems
- **Understand the problem first** - Patterns are solutions, not goals
- **Start simple** - Add patterns as complexity grows
- **Learn the trade-offs** - Every pattern has benefits and costs
