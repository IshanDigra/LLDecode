The task management system should allow users to create, update, and delete tasks.
Each task should have a title, description, due date, priority, and status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).
Users should be able to assign tasks to other users and set reminders for tasks.
The system should support searching and filtering tasks based on various criteria (e.g., priority, due date, assigned user).
Users should be able to mark tasks as completed and view their task history.
The system should handle concurrent access to tasks and ensure data consistency.
The system should be extensible to accommodate future enhancements and new features.


Entities:

2) User: id, name
3) TaskManager: Map<User, List<tasks>> task History - only completed tasks , List<Tasks> tasks - all tasks

Core FUnctionalities:
1) CRUD Operations for - task
2) assign task
3) set reminder
4) Search Task: priority, due date, assigned user
5) User -> Mark Task as completed, view task history of completed tasks

Questions to ask:
1) Once a task is assigned to a given user can it be changed to someone else.?
: Yes
2) Regarding the reminders what all functionality are we supposed to give. Single reminder. Reoccurring reminder.
automatic reminder post deadline.
: For the case of simplicity We are keep set reminder toggle where in post the deadline if a given task is not completed

the tasks post their deadlines and the reminder stuff.
