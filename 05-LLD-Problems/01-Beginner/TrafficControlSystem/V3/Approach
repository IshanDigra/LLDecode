#Requirement
------------

The traffic signal system should control the flow of traffic at an intersection with multiple roads.
The system should support different types of signals, such as red, yellow, and green.
The duration of each signal should be configurable and adjustable based on traffic conditions.
The system should handle the transition between signals smoothly, ensuring safe and efficient traffic flow.
The system should be able to detect and handle emergency situations, such as an ambulance or fire truck approaching the intersection.
The system should be scalable and extensible to support additional features and functionality.


Happy Flow:
system starts: current road signal turns green yellow red then next road and so on. In between emergency situation arises
in a given road it gets handled. and stuff goes back to normal.

Entities:
1) Road: id, name, TrafficSignal
2) TrafficSignal: id, currentSignal
3) SignalConfig: redDuration, greenDuration, yellowDuration
3) trafficSignalControl: List<Roads>, emergencySituationCheck,
Enums: signalType(RED, GREEN, YELLOW)

Util:
    - signal Id generator
    - Road Id generator

Core Functionalities:
signal change: green -> yellow -> red. This can be done via a queue mechanism. for loop will also work.
duration configurable: keeping it global for now.
emergency situation: event driven simulation: make the check true : handle the situation, then make it back false.

critical section:
signal change, emergency situation


Questions to Ask:
- Is the duration configuration global for all lights or vary for each light
Intuition: if keeping global then Signal Config will be part of trafficSignalControl else each traffic signal will have its
own set of signal config.
