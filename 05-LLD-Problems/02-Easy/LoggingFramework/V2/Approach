#Requirement
The logging framework should support different log levels, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL.
It should allow logging messages with a timestamp, log level, and message content.
The framework should support multiple output destinations, such as console, file, and database.
It should provide a configuration mechanism to set the log level and output destination.
The logging framework should be thread-safe to handle concurrent logging from multiple threads.
It should be extensible to accommodate new log levels and output destinations in the future.


Entities:
1) LogMessage: timestamp, content, log level
2) Configuration: LogLevel, OutputDestination
3) OutputDestination: console, DB, File
5) handler(DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL) : logLevel, nexHandler, processLog

Enums:
1) logLevel


Core Functionalities: setting the configuration, various log modes. handlers

Services:
Main Handler - The entry point.

Critical Section:
- setting of logging configurations.

Happy Flow:
User calls the logger function -> based on the logging configuration(Log Level & output Destination) we process the request.


Questions to Ask:
- Is this a local logging framework or global logging framework.
-


# things to lookout for
- logging
- concurrency handling
- exception handling
- Null Validations/ Edge cases
