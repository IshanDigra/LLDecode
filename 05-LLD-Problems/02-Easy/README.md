### StackOverflow
**Focus:** Content management and user interactions
- **Entities:** User, Question, Answer, Comment, Vote
- **Concepts:** Content management, voting system
- **Patterns:** Observer pattern, basic relationships
- **Complexity:** 5-6 entities, content relationships

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Understand the domain** - What does the system do?
2. **Identify core entities** - What are the main objects?
3. **Define relationships** - How do entities interact?
4. **Choose appropriate patterns** - Which patterns fit the problem?
5. **Implement step by step** - Build incrementally

## 💡 Key Concepts

### State Management
- Track object states (idle, active, completed)
- Handle state transitions
- Validate state changes

### Design Patterns
- **State Pattern** - For objects with changing behavior
- **Observer Pattern** - For event notifications
- **Strategy Pattern** - For interchangeable algorithms

### System Design
- Separate concerns (models, services, utilities)
- Handle edge cases and errors
- Design for extensibility
