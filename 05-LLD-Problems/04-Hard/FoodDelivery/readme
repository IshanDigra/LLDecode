* points to note:

1) whenever you are defining model items variable just try and look for real life based examples. for order we require status,
items, restaurant, deliveryAgent etc etc.
2) learn about observer desgin pattern. very important for notify customer & other kind of standard implementations. Apart from that
summarise the other fields as well that we wish to learn here. Time libraries. Executor services. Threads. etc etc. important stuff is pending.
