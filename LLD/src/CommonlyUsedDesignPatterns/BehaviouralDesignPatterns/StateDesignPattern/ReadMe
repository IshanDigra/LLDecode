so lets take an example of eating food. eatFood() is function. Now when your state is happy you are going to eat
some tasty food. when you state is normal you are going to eat normal home cooked food. when your state is sick
you are going to eat khickdi food. so the actionable eatFood() is same but based on your state the output and action changes.

One way to deal with this is based on the mood we make other functions. Or another way is to make a class whose
has a state object whose state can be changed and based on the state the object itself decides what function to call.
This object will basically be the state of me. happy sad etc.
