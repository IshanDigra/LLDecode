Key Points that we learn as we move ahead with the problem solving and learning new design patterns.

=> Design Pattern

=> Design Parking Lot
1) Always keep the method inputs as the parent class. for example you want to provide a ArayList<String> in method.
for this case while declaring the method just mention List<String> as its the parent class.
2) For this paticular Problem factory Pattern to generate the spot manager was unnecessary. Keep the time contstraints in
mind Always. Set 10 min for discussion and coming up with a solution and then max 30-40 minutes of coding. this means
only keep the necessary thing. lets say the interviewer has explicity mentioned for taking charging strategies then only
implement that rest keep same. Maintaining concurrency and other stuff is much more important than this. focus on that.




=> Design Tic Tac Toe
1) while solving this problem you wasted alot of time looking through the standard solution. This is not a right approach
2) first just go through the solution once after you have devised your own without loojing at the video and the notebook solution.
once you are satisfied. then start the timer and start coding. you track the time of you devising the solution as well.
but not the going through notebook and video.
